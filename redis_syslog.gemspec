We do rely on redis-rb, so go grab a copy if you haven't already! We originally wrote for FittrÂ® because our remote scripts needed to be easily checked to see if they were working or not. We now deploy RedisSyslog as a general purpose logging utility where our many services are able to concurrently log to.}
